# Sum Totient Range

In this project, I have parallalized a .c code for calculating "Euler Totient Range" between 2 numbers.
I have used OpenMP for this matter.
After finishing development I have cloned this code on Heriot-Watt Robotarium Cluster and ran it on 64 cores.
For make: gcc Totient.c -o totient
For run: ./totient lower upper
